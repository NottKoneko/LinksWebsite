# LinksWebsite

A simple dark-themed "link hub" page inspired by Linktree. Replace the placeholder links and images with your own to create a personal profile card.

## Usage
1. Edit `index.html` with your profile name, image, and URLs.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the page. All icon assets are stored
   locally so the page works even without an internet connection.
3. Tweak colors and layout in `style.css` if desired.
